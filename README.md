# Batch_WormShot [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/wsdt/Batch_WormShot.svg)](https://github.com/wsdt/Batch_WormShot/blob/master/LICENSE) [![made-with-bash](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Bash-1f425f.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

Control any Windows device remotely (if WormShot is installed there). 

To install WormShot got to the folder "C:\users\%username%\" and paste there the "WormShot"-folder of this repository. 
After that the control panel of ["Smart Speed" (=Batch Helper)](https://github.com/wsdt/Batch_Helper) should find the WormShot installation. 

Of course Wormshot needs to run in background, but fortunately I included several methods to install WormShot.

As I do not maintain this application and scripted this when I was appr. 13-15 years old, some things might not work anymore. Though there shouldn't be anything hardcoded, since I had the permission in school to test it by spreading it via a trojan. 
Nevertheless pull-requests and issues are welcome.
